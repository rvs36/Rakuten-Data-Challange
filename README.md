I took part in the Rakuten Data Challange and solved the various components for the multimodal product classification. 
As a part of the challangae, I have:

## 1. Trained a VGG 16 model from scratch
### ------ Details to follow soon-------  
## 2. Built a Neural Network for doing multiclass classification using text data
### ------ Details to follow soon-------  
## 3. Compared various Ensemble Learning Techniques on the TF - IDF matrix obtained from the text data
### ------ Details to follow soon-------
